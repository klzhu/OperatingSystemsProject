/* Author: Adem Efe Gencer, November 2015.
 *
 * This file describes the layout of a UFS-like file system.  A file is
 * a virtualized block store.  Each virtualized file is identified by a
 * so-called "inode number", which indexes into an array of inodes.
 *
 * The superblock maintains the magic number, the number of inode blocks,
 * and the number of freebitmap blocks. A magic number helps recognizing a
 * legitimate file system by identifying it via a sequence of bytes.
 *
 * Each ufs_inode contains the number of blocks in the virtual block
 * store, and is filled with REFS_PER_INODE block pointers:
 *     1. The top (REFS_PER_INODE - 3) pointers are direct pointers. A
 *     direct pointer points to a datablock.
 *     2. (REFS_PER_INODE - 2)th pointer is a singly indirect pointer: 
 *     points to an indirblock that then point to datablock(s).
 *     3. (REFS_PER_INODE -1)th pointer is a doubly indirect pointer:
 *     points to an indirblock that points to other indirblock(s) that
 *     then point to datablock(s).
 *     4. (REFS_PER_INODE)th pointer is a triply indirect pointer:
 *     points to an indirblock that points to other indirblock(s) that
 *     points to other indirblock(s) then point to datablock(s).
 *
 * A freebitmap block is a block of bits that is used to keep track of free
 * blocks in the file system. Each bit in a freebitmap block corresponds to
 * a block in the "remaining blocks" section of the layout. A value of 0
 * indicates that the block is not used, and a value of 1 indicates that the
 * block is in use. Freebitmap blocks do not keep bits to track the status
 * of superblock, inodes, or the other freebitmap blocks.
